Mon Dec 31 20:02:52 +0000 2018,Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors!? Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from....
Mon Dec 31 15:39:15 +0000 2018,"It’s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn’t work. It does\, and properly built\, almost 100%! They say it’s old technology - but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!"
Mon Dec 31 15:37:14 +0000 2018,"I’m in the Oval Office. Democrats\, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security\, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes\, but with me in office\, I’ll get it built\, and Fast!"

Mon Dec 31 14:38:52 +0000 2018,"I am the only person in America who could say that\, “I’m bringing our great troops back home\, with victory\,” and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever\, they would still be unhappy!"
Mon Dec 31 13:29:32 +0000 2018,"I campaigned on Border Security\, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an “Open Wound\,” where drugs\, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now!"
Mon Dec 31 13:19:13 +0000 2018,".....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS\, remember!"

Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media\, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived\, like to complain about me &amp; my tactics\, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!"
Mon Dec 31 13:03:05 +0000 2018,"If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria\, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President\, they would be a national hero. ISIS is mostly gone\, we’re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families\, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants......"
Mon Dec 31 12:51:22 +0000 2018,"An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED\, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!"
Sun Dec 30 21:59:44 +0000 2018,"President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree\, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing\, slightly larger version!"
Sun Dec 30 16:56:09 +0000 2018,Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!

The facts are out now. Whole Hoax exposed. @JesseBWatters"
Sun Dec 30 03:01:28 +0000 2018,"“Absolutely nothing” (on Russian Collusion). Kimberley Strassel\, The Wall Street Journal. The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics. The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats!"
Sat Dec 29 21:06:08 +0000 2018,"2018 is being called “THE YEAR OF THE WORKER” by Steve Moore\, co-author of “Trumponomics.” It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the “best job market in 50 years\, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains.”"
Sat Dec 29 19:25:47 +0000 2018,"For those that naively ask why didn’t the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year\, it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES\, and they will gives us “NONE” for Border Security! Now we have to do it the hard way\, with a Shutdown. Too bad! @FoxNews"
Sat Dec 29 18:36:17 +0000 2018,"...children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault\, he hadn’t given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard &amp; getting so little credit!"
Sat Dec 29 18:30:16 +0000 2018,"Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can’t. If we had a Wall\, they wouldn’t even try! The two....."
Sat Dec 29 16:03:02 +0000 2018,"Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made\, it will be very comprehensive\, covering all subjects\, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made!"
Sat Dec 29 15:52:24 +0000 2018,"I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security. From what I hear\, they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!"
Sat Dec 29 15:42:50 +0000 2018,"The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19\,000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover\, Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!"

Fri Dec 28 13:06:13 +0000 2018,".....Honduras\, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!"
Fri Dec 28 12:49:26 +0000 2018,".....close the Southern Border. Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA\, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico. Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border......"
Fri Dec 28 12:42:12 +0000 2018,"....The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA\, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount)\, that I would consider closing the Southern Border a “profit making operation.” We build a Wall or....."
Fri Dec 28 12:16:40 +0000 2018,We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall &amp; also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress &amp; President who would approve!
Thu Dec 27 23:23:36 +0000 2018,"CNN &amp; others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany. If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat\, I will sign. Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!"
Thu Dec 27 22:10:07 +0000 2018,"This isn’t about the Wall\, everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99.9%). This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump &amp; the Republicans have a win. They may have the 10 Senate votes\, but we have the issue\, Border Security. 2020!"
Thu Dec 27 21:26:10 +0000 2018,"Brad Blakeman: “The American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them.

Thu Dec 27 21:04:06 +0000 2018,There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!
Thu Dec 27 20:39:59 +0000 2018,"“Border Patrol Agents want the Wall.” Democrat’s say they don’t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed)\, and they don’t want ICE. They don’t have much to campaign on\, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!"
Thu Dec 27 19:44:49 +0000 2018,"The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain\, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling\, Dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today\, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall."
Thu Dec 27 19:41:45 +0000 2018,"The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall\, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built\, is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting &amp; expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years\, a U.S. record!"

Thu Dec 27 12:06:25 +0000 2018,"Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs\, Human Trafficking\,Gang Members &amp; Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?"

Mon Dec 24 17:32:44 +0000 2018,I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!
Mon Dec 24 17:23:22 +0000 2018,"Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria\, instead of the United States. See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country\, the U.S.\, that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!"
Mon Dec 24 17:10:22 +0000 2018,"The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is\, without the Wall\, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!"
Mon Dec 24 16:55:32 +0000 2018,"I never “lashed out” at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S.\, a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story\, one of many\, by the Fake News Media!"
Mon Dec 24 15:55:22 +0000 2018,"The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market\, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders.

Mon Dec 24 14:59:23 +0000 2018,"....We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world\, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S.\, and our TAXPAYERS\, on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO\, and it is being fixed!"
Mon Dec 24 14:41:02 +0000 2018,"To those few Senators who think I don’t like or appreciate being allied with other countries\, they are wrong\, I DO.

Mon Dec 24 14:31:50 +0000 2018,"Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence.

Mon Dec 24 04:05:26 +0000 2018,"The most important way to stop gangs\, drugs\, human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border.

Sun Dec 23 02:20:32 +0000 2018,"When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis\, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn’t\, I thought I should.
